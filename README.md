# About Computational-Social-Science
The course introduces computational approaches to model human behaviour and social phenomena. Core concepts in computational social science are covered, such as observational studies (what types of data exist, possible biases and how to use data for modelling), basic concepts and techniques for running experiments (asking vs. observing, natural experiments, simulations, validity and generalisation) and discuss key issues such as ethical considerations.

The course has both a theoretical and a practical perspective, where students learn basic principles and also how to apply them in practice in three main areas:
* social network analysis
* text analysis
* agent-based modelling and simulation.
